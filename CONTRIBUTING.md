# Rules and Contributing to MadOctopus' Turing Repository

<b> < Rules > </b>

Within the Turing repository, there is only one rule.


Please be appropiate and respectful to all. That means not making any rude or offensive files or comments about a person or a group of people.
This also applies to the contents of your files.
Failure to do so may result in the editing or removal of the comment or file. 
Multiple offensives of this rule will result in loss of privlages to the repository or removal from the organization for a time or permanently.

<b> < Proper Gitting > </b>

The Turing repository has some guidelines and edduqite towards "Proper Gitting". This includes:
- Making new files
- Editing existing files
- Commiting

<b> < Making New Files > </b>

- Anybody can create a new file at any time, but must create a new branch and pull request when commiting the file.
- The file must be accepted by an admin before it can be pulled into the master branch. The file will be checked for any innapropriate content and plagarism.
- The title of the commit must be ``` Create " file-name.ext " ```, where ``` file-name.ext ``` would be the name of your file.
- Keep your filenames short and without any illegal characters : ``` \ / : * ? " < > | ```
- The description must be filled and must say what the new file is and what it does or what it is for.
- If your new file is rejected, you can resubmit as long as you change what was wrong

<b> < Editing existing files > </b>

- Edits to a file must be meaningful and must change something within a file or files
- The change should be large enough to signify an actual change such as documentation or the actual working or look of a program.
- When editing someone's file, make a new branch and pull request and allow the owner of the file to accept or reject the change.

<b> < Commiting > </b>

- A commit must have a good descriptive title of what has changed OR the version number of the file.
- The description MUST be filled with what has changed in the file
- List your changes in point-form
- When editing something already existing in a file, try to include what it was originally and what it is now. Example:

``` Changed file version: v1.2.2 -> v1.2.3 ```

``` Fixed grammar: The pineapples are over their -> The pineapples are over there ```
- Make a new branch for a commit or a batch of commits
