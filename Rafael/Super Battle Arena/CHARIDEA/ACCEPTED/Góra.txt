Góra is a defensive-type character, he has high health and high defense to balance out his low attack and slow speed.
He own a shield called the "Patriarch", in which if he uses it during battle, reduces attacks from 20%-45% for 1 turn with
a 2 turn cooldown. He also can preform the Góran Rush, which increases his attack and speed at the cost of his defense, dealing 20%
more damage. His Earth Trembler attack is an average attack, don't do anything
