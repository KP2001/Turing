# Rules of the Turing repository

1. Before making a push to a project (updating a file), make a new branch for it.
  - You are not required to if you are working on your own project within your own folder
  
2. Do not merge any branches on your own (except if it's your own project)
  - @NotNemesis will merge them
  
3. Please describe your changes when pushing
  - Include relevant information such as what was fixed and if it resolved any previous issues
  
4. Be nice to each other and don't be a jerk

5. Do not close any branches or issues on your own
  - Unless you are working on your own project within your own folder
  
6. @NotNemesis is admin overlord

7. When creating a new file, you MUST create a new branch and pull request for it
  - Even if it is saved within your own folder, it will be checked over to make sure it compiles

8. Follow these rules
